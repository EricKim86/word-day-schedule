# work-day-schedule

## Description

This project utilizes the usage of day.js in order to provide the user real time date and time information.  The application utilizes day.js to color code a day scheduler by hour depending on whether the hour block is in the current hour, past, or future.  The user is able to add text to each hour block and save the text in local storage to be recalled automatically upon returning to the browser.

## Installation
